### A Grindr Username Generator  
#### üçÜ

Essentially a random **Grindr Username Generator**. No interface, no fuss. *gug* generates text and emojis mimicking real usernames from Grindr users in London. 

*gug* was exhibited at **square_one**, the University of Greenwich Second Year Show 2019.


[Here](https://www.francescoimola.com/528/we-all-want-to-be-loved) I talk about how the project came to life.
Also, find out more about [*Looking*](https://www.francescoimola.com/looking), *gug'* sister video work.
